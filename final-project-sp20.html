      <p class="text-muted"> <small>In this project, we used the open datasets released by Wikimedia to leverage both the underlying graphical nature of Wikipedia, as well as the semantic information encoded within each article's text using modern NLP techniques. We used that representation for each article to train a model to predict whether or not it would be a difficult concept to understand. Then we carefully designed an ETL pipeline to update a back-end system to support the model-scoring on a monthly basis.  We have a database and web application supporting the home page of a Chrome extension, allowing the user to highlight the important concepts of an article, and to see the expected time required to read the whole page. They can find similar articles to the one that they’re trying to learn about, or analogous concepts in other subjects that weren't connected through links. We also built a simplification priority queue for all the articles that don't currently have an existing simplified version, based on the expected amount of time the article would take to read. This could be used in conjunction with the article click demand to have a bounty system to incentivize the articles most in need to having a simplified version next.</small></p> <br/>

We have created a data science pipeline that incorporates methodologies such as data cleaning, data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, data modelling and model deployment to meet the objective. We have experimented various unsupervised models such as K-Means, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, LSTM, and ANN Auto-encoders to capture deviations in normal patterns. LSTM Auto-encoder outperformed other models with an F1-score of 67%.

      <p class="text-muted"> <small>Our goal is to provide a consolidated view of data on all outbreaks between 1996 to 2020. Though there are several news articles published in the WHO, CDC news section, there was limited resources for a consolidated view of all outbreaks around the world. Our dashboard summarizes all past outbreaks to include disease information, occurrences, deaths and reported cases. We integrated the COVID-19 data into an independent tab to track infected cases, recovered cases and fatalities for each country. While the source for the data for other outbreaks was from WHO/CDC, the source for the COVID-19 data was from Kaggle/John Hopkins Corona Virus Center through an API.
To consolidate data from other outbreaks, we extensively used web scraping and SpaCy NLP library in python to extract entities namely reported cases and deaths for each country and diseases that have resulted in an outbreak. For 67 diseases that have resulted in an outbreak in the past, we have compiled a database of pathogen name, pathogen host, pathogen source, mode of transmission, common symptoms, vaccination(yes/no) and incubation period. We used the combined information to cluster the outbreaks over the time period and compute the case fatality ratios for each disease and country.
To model the spread of a disease, we used the COVID-19 data, and set up a time dependent SIR model to track the variation in the transmission rate and recovery rate, which are complex parameters determined by several factors including government action to contain the disease spread. We used the learned transmission rate and recovery rate to predict the growth of infected cases by solving the ordinary differential equations for a SIR model. The model results show a gap in actual spread against the reported cases during the initial phase of the disease. The gap in reported cases could be due to various reasons such as insufficient testing, under reporting, longer incubation periods and low fatality ratios for a particular virus. Our model captures the fact that during an outbreak, it is always prudent to take action sooner, as the actual spread is quite different from the reported cases.</small></p> <br/>

      <p class="text-muted"> <small>It is tough for the majority of us without any formal training to gain the necessary information to make investment decisions. An uninformed investor has various questions on where he should put money and how much should he risk. Strategic Asset Manager(SAM) is able to guide investment strategy by being able to analyse the trends of the market and help you decide BUY and SELL strategies to maximize profits. Our machine learning approach uses NLP features generated from Edgar reports, global news sentiment and historical price data to forecast future values. LSTM model was used in conjunction with a rolling window approach to forecast 90 days values. Based on the returns, BUY and SELL strategies are then offered to the investors. SAM provides an easy to use interface to make investment decisions. It allows us to analyse a company's historical performance as well as compare its uncertainty and emotion results. Live executions of AWS services makes it possible for it to mine NLP features as well as answer user questions on Edgar reports based on a pre-trained BERT model. We have achieved knowledge from this project with a future scope of further building new features and hyper-tuning models. The problem of stock prediction is far from over, still more features can be analysed to give a stronger result and capture short term volatility to secure investments.</small></p> <br/>

Studies have shown that weather affects people's behaviors and spending. Through this project, we wanted to analyze the impact of weather on retail sales and devise a way to reliably forecast the sales and the quantity required by a retailer for a short forecast horizon. We integrated the data obtained from FIND AI with the weather data gathered from MeteoStat API. The data was then cleaned and transformed for further exploratory analysis, followed by modeling using various techniques. The models were then deployed on a Flask application, which worked as a dashboard for a user to view forecast results for each city and department.</small></p> <br/>

      <p class="text-muted"> <small>Sales or demand time series of a retailer could be organized along three dimensions: space, time, and product hierarchies. The spatial dimension captures the geographic distribution of the retail stores at different levels like country, province, city. The temporal dimension defines the chunks of time for which data is lumped together; for instance yearly, weekly or daily sales. And finally, the product hierarchy represents an administrative organization of products in some levels usually suggesting some degree of similarity: departments, categories, styles, etc.

In the context of a retail analytics software, the user might need forecasts at any of such spatio-tempoproduct hierarchical aggregation levels; for instance city-monthly-department or store-weekly-style. The challenge, though, is that going up and down the aggregation levels, the characteristics of the time series (like its shape, patterns of seasonality, etc.) will change making it difficult to simply have a single time series forecast model. The idea of this project is to explore methodologies to cope with this challenge. 

There are at least two fronts:
<ul>
<li>automatic choice of the appropriate model (either different types of models  or different parameters for the same class of models) for an aggregation  level</li>
<li>create bottom-up or top-down consistent forecasts along each dimension</li>
<li>find the optimal sweet spot of aggregation for more accurate forecasts</li>

      <p class="text-muted"> <small>Our project aims to make the Machine Learning model fair by mitigating the bias in   data. We have used tools that help in analyzing the dataset that gives us the   understanding of  data and would enable in detecting the bias based on the fairness metrics.  We started by analyzing the COMPAS dataset where we found the algorithm was biased towards the African-American Race. They were placed at higher risk of recidivism, however the ground truth didn’t match the algorithm predictions. We used EDA, Machine Learning Models, AIF360 explainers and What-If tool to understand the distribution of data across various protected attributes ( race/ gender/ age) and  detect the bias. We used Reweighing-pre-processing algorithm for bias mitigation and the results obtained were checked against the standard fairness metrics. We found significant improvement in the Fairness metrics after bias removal and also found decrease in False Positive Rate which means incorrect predictions. We explained the model through SHAP explainers and What-If tool. The results and the visualization that we obtained were hosted online which would be helpful for anyone who would like to know more about checking the biasness in the model. 
Concluding, we can say that we have shown a method that can be used to mitigate the bias of the Machine Learning Model and hence improve the Fairness of the model built. We have also shown the Model Transparency by explaining the Model in a simple and interpretable manner.</small></p> <br/>

Weather patterns influence how people decide, what type of clothings they buy or if to shop at all. People shop for clothing that helps them feel comfortable in the current or expected weather. Seasonal changes also influence fashion trends. Retail companies must, therefore, understand and predict shoppers’ behaviour to help better planning. Such demand forecasting helps these companies improve cost efficiencies as it provides reliable intelligence to better plan supply, manage inventory, and more efficiently staff stores.

      <p class="text-muted"> <small>The main goal of our project was to identify and predict anomalous movement in elevators in order to curtail incidents which are on the rise in Canada. We explored a large volume of elevator acceleration data, while learning about unsupervised anomaly detection, IOT and signal processing. Extensive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis were required to better understand the data.

We experimented with various machine learning models including LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost and Generalized ESD Test. Our LSTM model was able to detect anomalous vertical elevator movement in line with those found in literature. Anomalies on the horizontal axis, representing vibration, were detected using a Generalized ESD Test.  

We developed a streaming dashboard using Plotly Dash which is used for streaming the elevator data, identifying anomaly points in the data and also presented whether the elevator was ascending or descending.

We can improve upon these findings by creating or making use of labelled data or maintenance logs which can confirm anomalous conditions. We can also experiment with other deep learning models and technologies such as H2O.ai to provide insights into various models and make comparisons between them.</small></p> <br/>

      <p class="text-muted"> <small>In this project, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the movie box office. First, we collected the movie’s basic information by using BeautifulSoup python package as the scraping tool. The scraped dataset contained invalid data and noisy data which might influence the accuracy of our model result. To avoid this kind of issue, python pandas and other techniques(one-hot encoding, mean/sum encoding) were applied to process the raw data. After processing, we performed a model selection for better reflects the actual situation of the measured data and the XGBoost model standed out with higher accuracy. In the end, we combined the model prediction results and seaborn to provide visualization for clients. Based on the model, the movie box office can be predicted.</small></p> <br/>

      <p class="text-muted"> <small>The mission of our project is to develop a deep understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic spread and forecast its impact in the future. 
To accomplish the goal, we broke our tasks into multiple sections. In terms of exploratory data analysis, we created multiple visualizations on maps, plots etc. to understand how the virus is spreading across different countries and causing deaths.
Post EDA work, we focused on these two parts: a comparison of current time series prediction models on COVID-19 and government policy impact on this pandemic.  Most outputs were made available in a front-end for easy access as well. 
Firstly, we tested multiple time-series machine learning models to forecast the pandemic and compared how each model performs and how our predictions ranked up against real world data. Our models include ARIMA, MLP, Prophet, Linear+XGBRegressor, and a Canadian Provincial model. 
We also developed a Government policy model which used a dataset that was built by ourselves. We collected Canada policy data from news outlets and manually labelled them into different levels using domain knowledge. We built a linear regression model which shows that government policies have an impact on the epidemic in terms of “flattening the curve”, however, more data would be required to improve model accuracy.</small></p> <br/>

Making these smart choices is very crucial and we hope the project we’ve built can be used for these decisions. Our project aims to evaluate primary metrics that can help decide the right company to invest in. This crucial decision was made based on market sentiment analysis, stock values, sector wise analysis and financial KPIs like profit, revenue, total equities. Including sentiment based KPI helped us make the model based on not only non-budgeted performance indicators but also on informal factors for accurate insights. It is exciting to see data science expanding its lengths and breadths beyond the IT industry and having use cases in domains like business and finance. In conclusion, our model assisted investors to make smart decisions by deriving intuitive results leveraging analytical and prediction models.</small></p> <br/>

      <p class="text-muted"> <small>In summary, we aimed to extract effective inferences from our data that would benefit drug users, pharma companies and clinicians by receiving feedback of the drug based on opinion mining. We recommended top drugs for a given condition based on the sentiment score using VADER and LSTM model rating prediction. We also analyzed the emotion inclination towards a drug using 8 emotions. We get the best predictions with MLP + TF-IDF model, with an accuracy of 83%, outperforming baseline models. We trained our predictive models using NLP bag-of-words models (TF-IDF, Hashing) along with different tokenizers as part of text pre-processing. We also utilized Facebook's fastText to learn word embeddings and observed similarity among word groupings using t-SNE. Lastly, one of the most important features of our project is our interactive web application accomplishing two main goals, showcasing useful data insights and achieving real-time classification of sentiment.</small></p> <br/>

We have collected data from MIMIC-III, extracted, and cleaned clinical variables that were correlated with length of stay and mortality. We approached the prediction tasks in 2 different ways: using temporal vital signs measurements and applying to a GRU model, using static information combined with extracted earliest measurements of crucial vital signs and applying to an MLNN model. We selected features based on the SAPS-II system and RandomForest feature importance and then obtained 2 feature sets: SAPS-II features as a baseline feature set and our customized feature set, which we aimed to achieve a better performance than the baseline feature set. For the short term length of stay prediction, we got 75.32% accuracy and 82.06% AUROC with GRU model using our customized feature set, outperforming the baseline model. For the long term length of stay prediction, we got 73.26% accuracy and 80.97% AUROC with the MLNN model using our customized feature set, which performed better than the baseline model. For in-hospital mortality prediction, we got 78.21% accuracy and 86.04% AUROC with the MLNN model using our customized feature set, outperforming the baseline model as well.</small></p> <br/>
